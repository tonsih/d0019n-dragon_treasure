# DragonTreasure (D0019N - Assignment 3)

This project was developed in connection with the course D0019N - "Software
Development with Java" provided by Lule√• University of Technology.

DragonTreasure is a game where the player navigates through a dungeon finding
various helpful items for assisting the player in defeating the obstacles along
the way. The goal of the game is to exit the dungeon alive, which is also
the prerequisite for the player to win the game. If the player chooses to quit
the game or dies, the game ends and the player loses.


## How to play

The game can be run directly via an IDE (e.g. NetBeans, IntelliJ or Eclipse,
etc.), by downloading the source files in the src-directory and running the
"Main"-class method "main"

Another way to run the game is to run the pre-built jar-file located in
"out/artifacts/d0019n_exuppg3_jar/d0019n-exuppg3.jar" via a UNIX terminal
(tested on Linux), or via Windows Powershell/CMD.

Navigate to the jar-file location with the terminal (or provide the whole path
to file) and run:
java -jar d0019n-exuppg3.jar

**Note**: Due to the inability for providing some visual effects for the
terminal within an IDE environment, the game provides an option to decide the
running environment in the beginning of the game. Choosing the IDE-alternative
disables these visual effects in question.

The results for running the game via a Windows Powershell/CMD can provide
varying results depending on the availibity for the tools to clear the tools,
if the option for running the game via a Windows Powershell/CMD terminal is
checked. If errors occurs in this case, choose the the option for running the
game via an IDE environment for disabling the visual effects.
